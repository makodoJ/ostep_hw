# Segmentation
## Homework (Simulation)
This program allows you to see how address translations are performed in a system with segmentation. See the README for details.
## Questions
1.First let’s use a tiny address space to translate some addresses. Here’s a simple set of parameters with a few different random seeds; can you translate the addresses?
```
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 1
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 2
```
